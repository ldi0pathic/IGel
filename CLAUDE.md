[Project: SocialSnag maintenance](https://github.com/users/jamditis/projects/15)

## What this is

SocialSnag is a Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that downloads full-resolution images and videos from social media through a right-click context menu or a direct post-link form on its GitHub Pages site.

**Repo:** https://github.com/jamditis/socialsnag (public)
**Version:** 1.3.0
**Author:** Joe Amditis

## Architecture

ESM modules in `src/`, bundled by esbuild to `dist/`. Chrome loads from `dist/`.

```
src/
  background.js          - service worker for context menus, external landing-page requests, downloads, URL validation, download history, Instagram API resolution, zip and copy-URL routing, and optional webRequest
  platforms/common.js    — shared exports: ALLOWED_DOMAINS, isAllowedDomain, isHttps, sanitizeFilename, findPostContainer, findNearestMedia, getCapturedMedia, isContentSized
  platforms/instagram.js — Instagram DOM resolver (srcset upgrade, JSON extraction, video script extraction, carousel support) — the fallback when the API path fails
  platforms/instagram-api.js — Instagram private web API (pure module): shortcodeToMediaId, parsePostMedia (single + carousel), extractStoryRef, parseStoryTray, mapIgStatusToMessage
  platforms/twitter.js   — Twitter/X resolver (name=orig rewrite, profile pic upgrade, video via webRequest captures)
  platforms/facebook.js  — Facebook resolver (fbcdn upgrade, video extraction from scripts)
  platforms/bluesky.js   — Bluesky resolver (feed_fullsize upgrade, avatar upgrade, direct video URLs)
  platforms/linkedin.js  — LinkedIn resolver (media.licdn.com host gate, chrome-rendition filter, activity-id extraction); optional platform, off until the user grants site access in options
  platforms/tiktok.js    — TikTok ESM resolver and parser — not bundled pending download transport proof
  platforms/youtube.js   — YouTube resolver — NOT in manifest, fully excluded
  popup.html/js/css      — popup UI: dark theme, platform status grid, download history with SVG icons
  options.html/js/css    — settings: card layout, custom toggle switches, save on change
  offscreen.html/js      — offscreen document: builds zips (client-zip) and writes the clipboard, which an MV3 service worker cannot do directly
  offscreen-host.js      — service-worker side helpers to create the offscreen doc and call it (copyViaOffscreen, zipViaOffscreen, revokeViaOffscreen)
  fonts/syne.woff2       — Syne display font (bundled, not CDN)
  fonts/outfit.woff2     — Outfit body font (bundled, not CDN)
docs/
  demo.js                - landing-page form controller for external extension messaging, visible response mapping, and timeout handling
```

### Build

```bash
npm install                    # install dev deps (esbuild, vitest, eslint)
npm run build                  # bundle to dist/
npm run build:zip              # bundle + minify + create socialsnag-{version}.zip
npm test                       # run the full test suite
npm run lint                   # eslint src/
npm run publish:cws            # upload the built zip and publish (needs CWS_* env; see docs/cws-publishing.md)
```

### Right-click message flow

1. User right-clicks on supported site
2. Background receives `contextMenus.onClicked`, calls `chrome.tabs.sendMessage({ action: 'resolve' })`
3. Content script's resolver finds media URLs in the DOM (or extracts from page scripts for blob: videos)
4. Content script responds with `{ urls: [...], platform: '...' }`
5. Background validates each URL (HTTPS, domain allowlist, dot-boundary check), sanitizes filename, downloads
6. Background records download to `chrome.storage.local` history

### Submitted post-link flow

1. The GitHub Pages form sends `{ action: 'downloadSubmittedUrl', url }` to the published extension ID through `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()`
2. `onMessageExternal` accepts only the exact GitHub Pages origin and `/socialsnag/` path, then validates the direct post URL before network or tab work
3. The extension resolves the post through a bounded platform API request or an inactive browser tab, using the browser's existing signed-in session where needed
4. The extension validates each media URL, starts downloads, and records the same filename, platform, and timestamp history used by right-click downloads
5. Only `{ ok, code, platform, count }` returns to the page, which renders a visible success or failure state

Submitted post URLs, resolved CDN URLs, page content, cookies, and account data do not cross back to the GitHub Pages site or enter SocialSnag storage. Logged-out, private, inaccessible, expired, deleted, rate-limited, and unsupported cases return bounded failure codes instead of success.

### ESM module pattern

Each platform file exports pure functions (testable in Node) and keeps browser wiring in `initContentScript()`:

```js
// Pure functions — exported for testing
export function upgradeImageUrl(url) { ... }

// Browser wiring — guarded, only runs in Chrome
function initContentScript() { ... }
if (typeof document !== 'undefined' && typeof chrome !== 'undefined' && chrome.runtime?.id) {
  initContentScript();
}
```

The `typeof document` guard prevents ReferenceErrors when Vitest imports the module.

### Storage areas

- `chrome.storage.sync` — user preferences (platform toggles, notification setting, advancedMode flag)
- `chrome.storage.local` — download history (max 50 entries, pruned on write)
- `chrome.storage.session` — captured media URLs from webRequest (ephemeral)
- Submitted post URLs are not stored in any Chrome storage area

### Domain allowlist (single source of truth)

`ALLOWED_DOMAINS` is defined once in `src/platforms/common.js` and imported by `src/background.js`. The list:
- `cdninstagram.com`, `pbs.twimg.com`, `video.twimg.com`, `fbcdn.net`, `cdn.bsky.app`, `video.bsky.app`, `media.licdn.com`

An opt-in platform's CDN belongs on this list like any other. The host permission decides whether the resolver ever runs; the allowlist decides whether a URL it hands back may be downloaded, and both have to say yes.

## Chrome Web Store compliance

### Platforms included in CWS submission
Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook, Bluesky (upfront host permissions), plus LinkedIn behind an opt-in grant.

### Opt-in platforms
- **LinkedIn** — shipped, off by default. Bundled by `build.js` and registered at runtime, never declared in `content_scripts`; its hosts live in `optional_host_permissions`, so nothing is injected until the user turns LinkedIn on in options and accepts the site-access prompt. Carries medium-high CWS rejection risk.

The flow, which any further opt-in platform should copy:
1. `OPTIONAL_PLATFORMS` in `src/background.js` names the origins to request, the page patterns the menu may appear on, and the script to inject. The CDN origin is requested but never becomes a menu pattern or an injection target.
2. `menuUrlPatterns()` and `contentScriptRegistrations()` add a platform only when **every** one of its origins is granted; a partial grant resolves and then fails the `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` check, so it is treated as off.
3. **Keep it out of `content_scripts`.** A static entry's match pattern is an install-time host permission: Chrome warns on it at update, grants it, and injects without ever consulting the optional grant, which makes the opt-in cosmetic. `reconcileOptionalContentScripts()` registers it through `chrome.scripting` instead, diffing what is granted against `getRegisteredContentScripts()`. Registrations persist across sessions, so a plain register at startup would fail on a duplicate id.
4. The registered `js` list names files as `dist` has them, one bundle per platform. `build.js` strips `platforms/common.js` from the static entries because esbuild inlines it; a runtime registration gets no such rewrite, so naming a source-only path fails the whole call.
5. `chrome.permissions.onAdded` / `onRemoved` rebuild the menu and re-run that reconcile, so a grant or a revoke made from `chrome://extensions` takes effect without a reinstall.
6. The options toggle requests or removes the origins and restores its checked state from `chrome.permissions.contains`. It keeps **no** mirrored `platform_<name>` flag: the grant is the state, read everywhere through `isPlatformEnabled()`. A stored copy goes stale the moment someone uses `chrome://extensions`, and the menu and the download gate then disagree.

The popup reads optional platform status from the complete live permission grant.
It adds LinkedIn when granted and removes the row when access is revoked. LinkedIn
video collection accepts only HTTPS URLs on the existing download allowlist,
deduplicates them, and numbers only accepted items. Other video hosts are skipped;
this does not establish support for additional CDNs or expand permissions.

### Platforms excluded
- **YouTube** — fully removed. Google removes YT download extensions.
- **TikTok** — ESM resolver code and parser tests are in the repo, but the resolver is not bundled. The download transport still needs proof before it can copy the LinkedIn opt-in flow: the removed branch called `URL.createObjectURL()` from the MV3 service worker, where that API is unavailable. Medium-high CWS rejection risk.

### Permission model
- Core: `contextMenus`, `downloads`, `activeTab`, `storage`, `notifications`, `scripting`, `offscreen`
- Optional: `clipboardWrite`, `webRequest`
- `clipboardWrite` is optional (not upfront) on purpose: adding an install-warning permission to a published extension disables it for every existing user until they re-approve. The copy handler requests it on the first "Copy media URL" click (a context-menu click carries the user gesture), so the update installs silently and only people who copy ever see a prompt. `webRequest` is toggled via "advanced mode" in settings.
- Host permissions (upfront): Instagram + CDN, Twitter/X + CDN, Facebook + CDN, Bluesky + CDN
- Optional host permissions: LinkedIn + CDN, TikTok + CDN

### Security requirements
- **Domain allowlist with dot-boundary check** — `hostname === d || hostname.endsWith('.'+d)`
- **HTTPS only** — reject non-HTTPS download URLs
- **Filename sanitization** — strip `../`, `..\`, and `<>:"/\|?*` characters
- **Sender validation** — `sender.id === chrome.runtime.id` on all background onMessage handlers
- **No remote code** — everything bundled, fonts included as woff2
- **No URL storage** — download history stores filename/platform/timestamp, NOT the CDN URL
- **External sender validation:** landing-page requests are limited to the exact GitHub Pages origin and project path
- **Bounded external response:** the landing page receives only success or failure, platform, and count, never resolved URLs or account data

## Development

### Load the extension
1. `npm install && npm run build`
2. `chrome://extensions` > Developer mode > Load unpacked > select `dist/` folder

### Key files to check after changes
- `manifest.json` — permissions, content_scripts, version
- `src/background.js` — the security gate (URL validation, `validateDownloadUrl()`)
- `docs/demo.js`: the GitHub Pages form controller and external request wrapper
- `src/platforms/common.js` — shared domain allowlist
- `src/offscreen.js` / `src/offscreen-host.js` — the offscreen document and its service-worker callers (sender validation, zip/copy/revoke)
- `build.js` — entry points, manifest rewrite, asset copying

### Testing
```bash
npm test                           # run the full test suite
npx vitest run test/instagram.test.js  # single file
npm run test:watch                 # watch mode
```

### CI
GitHub Actions runs lint + test + build on every PR to master (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Instagram video downloads

Instagram videos use `blob:` URLs (MediaSource API). Direct `video.src` is always unusable. SocialSnag extracts the actual CDN video URL from Instagram's embedded page scripts:

1. `extractVideoUrlFromScripts(scriptTexts)` searches for `"video_url":"..."` and `"video_versions":[{"url":"..."}]` patterns
2. `decodeJsonString()` handles `\/` and `\u0026` JSON escapes
3. Script texts are cached per container to avoid repeated DOM queries
4. A `Set` tracks used URLs to prevent duplicates when multiple blob: videos exist

This works without advanced mode (webRequest) enabled.

## Current status

### Implemented, not yet released (v1.3.0)

- The GitHub Pages landing page includes a prominent direct post-link form that delegates downloads to the locally installed extension while preserving the right-click workflow.
- The GitHub Pages deployment and Chrome Web Store extension update are separate release gates. Both must be live before the pasted-link workflow is available to users. Publishing either one does not publish the other.
- Release order is Chrome Web Store first, then GitHub Pages. Do not merge the Pages form to `master` until v1.3.0 is live in the store, so the public form never advertises a workflow that the published extension cannot receive.

### Done (v1.2.1)
- Instagram feed and profile-grid carousels enumerate every slide. The content script recovers the post's shortcode from the DOM permalink (clicked-target ancestor link first, then the enclosing article, then the container) and hands it to the background, which resolves the whole post through the media API. Fixes feed/grid "download all" capping at the ~2 slides Instagram lazy-renders (#32).
- Chrome Web Store publish automation: `npm run publish:cws` uploads the built zip and publishes the item through the Chrome Web Store API. Credentials are read from the environment, never committed; one-time OAuth setup is in `docs/cws-publishing.md`.

### Done (v1.2.0)
- Instagram carousel and bulk download resolve through the media API (every slide, in order), with DOM scraping as the fallback
- Instagram stories: the viewed story and the user's whole active tray, via the reels_media API
- Copy media URL and download-all-as-zip, both routed through the extension's first offscreen document (client-zip for the archive)
- `zipMultiPosts` global setting plus a per-download .zip menu item that overrides it
- Context menu reorganized under a SocialSnag parent submenu
- Specific Instagram error messages: login required, rate-limited, expired or deleted
- Dead TikTok code path removed from the service worker
- 210 unit tests (vitest)
- New permissions: `offscreen` (required); `clipboardWrite` (optional, requested on first Copy media URL) — no new host permissions

### Done (v1.1.0)
- 4 platforms: Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook, Bluesky
- ESM + esbuild build pipeline
- 122 unit tests (vitest)
- GitHub Actions CI
- Dark-themed popup and options UI with bundled fonts
- CWS screenshots, promo tile, landing page
- GitHub releases: v1.0.0, v1.1.0
- Twitter/X video downloads via syndication API (background script, no webRequest needed)
- Instagram video downloads via media API with shortcode-to-mediaId conversion
- Configurable download folder path in settings
- CWS submission completed 2026-03-20, approved and published 2026-03-23
- Extension ID: `llbpeneloehnlaomolbalbmhjncpmnfa`

### Chrome Web Store
- **Initial CWS publish date:** 2026-03-23 — Item ID: `llbpeneloehnlaomolbalbmhjncpmnfa`
- **1.2.1 published and live:** 2026-07-07. Passed Google review; the Instagram feed/grid carousel fix and the CWS publish automation are now on all users' installs.
- The publish script (`npm run publish:cws`) reads this item id from `package.json` `cws.itemId`; `CWS_ITEM_ID` overrides it. See docs/cws-publishing.md.
- CWS listing (source of truth for dates/versions): https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/socialsnag/llbpeneloehnlaomolbalbmhjncpmnfa

### Pending
- Upload social preview image in GitHub Settings > General > Social preview

### Future work
- TikTok as an optional platform after its CDN download transport is proven, then wired on the LinkedIn pattern
- Automated E2E tests with Playwright
